# 🍔 Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

This project is a **Deep Learning-based Food Recognition Model** that accurately detects food items from images and estimates their calorie content. The model helps users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies **101 different food categories** from images.
- Estimates **calories per gram** for the predicted food item.
- Uses **DenseNet201** as the backbone for accurate image classification.
- Supports real-time **image prediction and visualization**.
